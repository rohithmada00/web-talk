## **Privacy Policy for Web Talk**

**Effective Date:** April 21, 2025

Web Talk (“the Extension”) is a browser extension developed to enable voice-controlled browsing functionality. This Privacy Policy describes how Web Talk handles user information and ensures transparency in its operations. By using this extension, you agree to the practices described below.

---

### **Information Collection and Usage**

Web Talk does **not collect, store, or transmit** any personally identifiable information (PII). The Extension operates entirely on the client side and does not communicate with external servers.

To enable its core functionality, Web Talk may temporarily access the following:

- **Website Content**: The extension accesses page elements to perform actions such as clicking buttons or reading text aloud in response to user voice commands.
- **User Activity**: Web Talk monitors browser actions such as active tabs or navigation events solely to fulfill voice-initiated tasks.

This data is processed **locally** in your browser and is not shared or stored beyond the duration of your interaction.

---

### **Permissions Justification**

Web Talk requests certain permissions solely to support its voice-based automation features:

- **`tabs` and `activeTab`** – Used to determine and interact with the user’s currently active tab.
- **`scripting`** – Required to dynamically inject voice processing scripts into web pages.
- **`<all_urls>` (host permissions)** – Allows the extension to operate on any website, ensuring compatibility with user browsing behavior.

These permissions are not used for any purpose beyond the core functionality of voice-based browser interaction.

---

### **Data Sharing and Third Parties**

Web Talk does **not sell, share, or transfer** user data to third parties.  
The Extension also does not engage in any of the following activities:

- Use of user data for advertising or marketing
- Data profiling or behavioral analysis
- Transfer of data for creditworthiness or lending purposes

---

### **Remote Code Policy**

Web Talk does **not** utilize remote code. All scripts, libraries, and resources are packaged within the extension and served locally during execution. No part of the codebase is loaded from external sources.

---

### **Updates to This Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in functionality or regulatory requirements. Users are encouraged to review this policy for the latest information.
