    <h2>Information Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      Web Talk does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit</strong> any personally identifiable information (PII).
      The Extension operates entirely on the client side and does not communicate with external servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enable its core functionality, Web Talk may temporarily access the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> To perform actions such as clicking buttons or reading text aloud in response to user voice commands.</li>
      <li><strong>User Activity:</strong> To monitor browser actions such as active tabs or navigation events solely to fulfill voice-initiated tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is processed <strong>locally</strong> in your browser and is not shared or stored beyond the duration of your interaction.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Permissions Justification</h2>
    <p>Web Talk requests certain permissions solely to support its voice-based automation features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>tabs and activeTab:</strong> Used to determine and interact with the user’s currently active tab.</li>
      <li><strong>scripting:</strong> Required to dynamically inject voice processing scripts into web pages.</li>
      <li><strong>&lt;all_urls&gt; (host permissions):</strong> Allows the extension to operate on any website, ensuring compatibility with user browsing behavior.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are not used for any purpose beyond the core functionality of voice-based browser interaction.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      Web Talk does <strong>not sell, share, or transfer</strong> user data to third parties.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use of user data for advertising or marketing</li>
      <li>Data profiling or behavioral analysis</li>
